                        In 1927, as the Forrest Theater in Philadelphia broke ground right next-door,
                the Moriarty’s building became a bar and for over 77 years it has been serving
                the public delicious food and spirits. Today, Moriarty’s Restaurant and Irish Pub
                continues the tradition by offering quality food, great drinks and warm hospitality
                to our restaurant patrons and clientele that rent our premier banquet facilities.
                Celebrating our 31st year in this historic location, we at Moriarty’s are proud
                to be Philly’s favorite Irish Pub. We have won numerous city awards, including
                Best of Philly, City Paper’s Choice, and Best of Penn for our famous wings. We
                serve the Perfect Pint of Guinness as well as 27 other draft beers and 50 bottled
                beers.

                         Moriarty’s is currently enjoying success as an Irish pub and restaurant that
                incorporates a mixture of the old and new with a distinctive Irish feel. We
                celebrate the past with our classic atmosphere and flair for details. At Moriarty’s
                Restaurant, historic and vintage memorabilia cover the walls from floor to ceiling.
                Rare prints, collectable water pitchers, and historic photos have been well
                preserved throughout the years. The magnificent sixty-five foot mahogany bar
                was created by 2 Irish crafts man making it the focal point of the first floor in
                this traditional Irish pub in bustling Center City Philadelphia. The second floor
                hosts an imported antique bar as the centerpiece of the elegant dining room
                ambience. The second and the third floors have working fireplaces that we fire up
                every winter to create a comfy atmosphere. Moriarty’s offers a range of
                international cuisine to suit all tastes, including signature Mexican, Irish and
                American dishes. Our proximity to historic downtown Philadelphia and the new
                Constitution Center makes Moriarty’s an ideal stop for bus and tour groups. Stop
                by after you visit our neighbors, the Walnut Street Theater or the Forrest Theater,
                for a show in Philadelphia and create the perfect ending to your night on the
                town.
